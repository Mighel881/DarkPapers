# DarkPapers
DarkPapers by alex_png - Dark mode wallpapers, but your way.

DarkPapers is a tweak that adds over **50 OLED friendly and Full HD day/night wallpapers** into the native iOS 13 native appearance aware feature _(the automatic wallpaper switch between the light and dark version whenever dark mode is enabled/disabled)_.

Once you install the tweak, **no setting up is required**. Simply head over to the native wallpaper section of the settings app of your device and choose one of the newly added wallpapers from DarkPapers that can be found in the still wallpapers tab.    

DarkPapers depends on **WallpaperLoader** from Skittyblock in order to add the pre-installed wallpapers into the stock wallpaper section in the settings app. 

## Information
**Compatibility:** Supports all versions of iOS 13. Currently, the pre-installed wallpapers are **not sized for iPads**.

**Dependencies:** WallpaperLoader from Skittyblock.

**Known Issues:** Sometimes when previewing a wallpaper before applying it in the settings app, the wallpaper will zoom in. You can apply the wallpaper either way as it will not appear zoomed in once you set it as your wallpaper. To fix this issue simply leave the preview of the wallpaper and preview it again. To recreate this bug, preview one of the DarkPaper wallpapers and toggle the dark mode on/off.

## How can I install this on my device?
Visit or add my repository to your package manager:

## TODO
- Add compatibility for iPad devices;
- Fix zooming issue on some device models;
- Add new wallpapers.

## NOTES
Please note that due to limitations with GitHub I had to separate the wallpapers into packs due to the sizing of the debian file. This means that an additional 10 packs will be installed with DarkPapers which is the total of the 50 wallpapers. You can uninstall the ones you don’t like as it won’t conflict with any of the other packs nor with DarkPapers. If you uninstall WallpaperLoader, both DarkPapers and all the packs will be uninstalled as well. If you uninstall DarkPapers, the packs won’t be removed except the pack that comes with DarkPapers. You can also install individual packs without needing to install DarkPapers, in case you don’t want all the wallpapers or have less space storage on your device.
