# DarkPapers
DarkPapers by alex_png - Dark mode wallpapers, but your way.

DarkPapers is a tweak that adds over **50 OLED friendly and Full HD day/night wallpapers** into the native iOS 13 native appearance aware feature _(the automatic wallpaper switch between the light and dark version whenever dark mode is enabled/disabled)_.

Once you install the tweak, **no setting up is required**. Simply head over to the native wallpaper section of the settings app of your device and choose one of the newly added wallpapers from DarkPapers that can be found in the still wallpapers tab.    

DarkPapers depends on **WallpaperLoader** from Skittyblock in order to add the pre-installed wallpapers into the stock wallpaper section in the settings app. 

## Information
**Compatibility:** Supports all versions of iOS 13. Currently, the pre-installed wallpapers are **not sized for iPads**.

**Dependencies:** WallpaperLoader from Skittyblock.

**Known Issues:** Sometimes when previewing a wallpaper before applying it in the settings app, the wallpaper will zoom in. You can apply the wallpaper either way as it will not appear zoomed in once you set it as your wallpaper. To fix this issue simply leave the preview of the wallpaper and preview it again. To recreate this bug, preview one of the DarkPaper wallpapers and toggle the dark mode on/off.
